# Toroidal Game of Life - Algorithms and Data Structures I

This is a simulation of Conway’s Game of Life with toroidal grid wrapping, developed as part of the course **Algorithms and Data Structures I**.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells evolve across generations based on simple rules. This version uses a toroidal grid, where the top and bottom edges, and the left and right edges, wrap around.

Key features:
- Grid wrapping (toroidal topology)
- Step-by-step simulation
- Utility functions for evolution and state comparison

📚 Focus: dynamic memory allocation, 2D arrays, modular design in C++ and cellular automata.
